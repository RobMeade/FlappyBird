# Flappy Bird 

This game is a recreation of the 2013 classic Flappy Bird by Dong Nguyen.

This game has been created solely for educational purposes.  The original aim was to recreate Flappy Bird as accurately as possible, this included the speeds and timings of both gameplay mechanics and animated user-interfaces.  A lot of time was spent researching, recording gameplay videos, and studying each of the game's features.  After a very successful beginning, I decided to use this project as a candidate for migration from Blueprint to C++.

## Features
- Endless play
- Replayability (frustratingly so!)
- Randomised bird colour (red, yellow, blue)
- Randomised day / night background
- Sound effects
- Animated user-interfaces
- Achievement medals (bronze, silver, gold, and platinum)
- Saved high score

## Development

The project was created using Unreal Engine (4.26).  Code was initially written using Blueprint with aspects later migrated to C++.  The project makes use of Enums, Flipbooks, Sound Cues, Material Instances, User Widgets, to support both gameplay and the user-interfaces.

## Further Development

Plans for further development include;

- Quit game option for Windows builds
- Leaderboard functionality
- Further C++ migration

## Assets
Many of the 2D art assets were sourced from GitHub, the remaining (missing) assets were created by myself using original gameplay recordings as reference.  Game audio was sampled from the original game.

It should be noted that permission was not sought/given by the original author (Dong Nguyen) to recreate any part of the original game, or the use of the game's assets.
